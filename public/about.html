<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Otso and i am a game developer.</p>

<p>
  I have studied game development at Ahlman for close to 3 years now. My passion
  is programming and i have focused on UI(not necessarily on my own will ;) ) on
  most of our school projects. I have also done some AI programming and made
  powerup systems.

<p>
  I have also done some 3D modeling and texturing. I have used Blender for this.
  I am also familiar with Photoshop.
